<p id="inst"> If you watched the video below ask yourself what you learned from each video and what each video provided in terms of short-term and long term solutions. Why is it important to teach others about the importance of environmental issues? What other issues-such as animal endangerment and water pollution- needs more attention in order to create an eco-friendly environment?  </p>
  <p id="inst"> The first major step in fighting for future generations up is bringing these pressing matters into conversation. Watch one of these documentaries above and try to talk about the different aspects surrounding the current environment. </p>
 <p id="inst"> Besides discussion and looking online for petitions which can be beneficial, it has come to light that just recently the Supreme Court removed The EPA's regulation of air pollution.
